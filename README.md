# Car-Price-Prediction
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

# Dataset Description
The dataset “customer_data.csv” contains 400 records
representing some of the company’s previous customers. The customer
data is composed of the customer’s age and salary. The final column (i.e.,
the target) is a boolean value (0 if the customer didn’t purchase a new car
and 1 if he/she purchased a new car).
